# Mentions
This component allow users to mention other friends into the comments (only). Once the comment is submitted people can view mentioned user profile also.

This is just a UI and doesn't send any notification to mentioned user, for that purpose you can use mentioned users component on top of this : https://www.opensource-socialnetwork.org/component/view/4864/mention-notifications

NOTE
During mention it doesn't support spaces example @Some User it will not return anything but @Some will return friends with such a name. It will only show a friends not all users.
